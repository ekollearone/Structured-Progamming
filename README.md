1.This is a c program to SWAP 2 numbers without using third variable.
       This is a code that assign the value of num1 to num2 and the value of num2 to num1.To use this SWAP algorithm simply call the two_swap function.The function returns the value of num1 to num2 and the value of num2 to num1.The code is called two_swap.c.
2. This is a c program to calculate the remainder of two numbers without using the % operator.
       This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the remainder of two numbers without using the modulus (%) operator in programming.To use this code simply provide the dividend and divisor values and run it to see the result.The code is called remainder.c.
3.This is a c program to calculate the sum of digits of a 3 digit number.
       This code snippet demonstrates how to calculate the sum of digits of a 3 digit number in programming.To use this code simply provide the 3 digit number and run it to see the result.The code is called sum.c.
4.This is a c program to print the reverse of a 3-digit number.
       This code snippet demonstrate a function that calculate and print the reverse of a 3-digit number in programming.To use this code provide a 3-digit number as input to the function and run it to display the reverse number.The code is called reverse.c.
